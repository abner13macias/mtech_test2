MTech Systems Dev Test 2

Create a solution that can: 
* Persist Employees to a data store
* Validate uniqueness of an employee (uniqueness is defined by RFC)
* Validate RFC Format and length
* Retrieve Employees sorted by born date and filtered optionally by name

Considerations:
* UI can be any Microsoft presentation Technology (Web API, ASP.NET MVC, etc.)
* The components used should be able to be consumed by an alternate presentation layer
* Don't focus on aesthetics
* Any 3rd party libraries can be used
* Any code that you've built for previous applications can be used.
